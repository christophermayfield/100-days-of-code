### R1D1 Friday January 5th 2018

Looking forward to starting coding more seriously. I have always wanted to do it as a career, but I haven't pushed myself enough yet. I'm 27, but its never too late right? I want to do some meaningful work in my life, so the only way to do it is by starting right?

Today I am focusing on getting my github repo setup, and thinking about some projects to do.
