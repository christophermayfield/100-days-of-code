### R1D1 Friday January 5th 2018

Looking forward to starting coding more seriously. I have always wanted to do it as a career, but I haven't pushed myself enough yet. I'm 27, but its never too late right? I want to do some meaningful work in my life, so the only way to do it is by starting right?

Today I am focusing on getting my github repo setup, and thinking about some projects to do.

In addition, I started doing a small portfolio coding project for freeCodeCamp just so i can get myself in the coding mood.


### R1D2 Saturday January 6th 2018

I did some more work on my portoflio project today. Today I went to Disneyland with Karina, so I barely was able to get a full hour of coding today, but i pushed some code to github, which was good.
