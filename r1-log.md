## Log

### R1D1 Friday January 5th 2018

Looking forward to starting coding more seriously. I have always wanted to do it as a career, but I haven't pushed myself enough yet. I'm 27, but its never too late right? I want to do some meaningful work in my life, so the only way to do it is by starting right?

Today I am focusing on getting my github repo setup, and thinking about some projects to do.

In addition, I started doing a small portfolio coding project for freeCodeCamp just so i can get myself in the coding mood.


### R1D2 Saturday January 6th 2018

I did some more work on my portoflio project today. Today I went to Disneyland with Karina, so I barely was able to get a full hour of coding today, but i pushed some code to github, which was good.



### R1D3 Sunday January 7th 2018

I didn't code today. I really wanted to, but I wasn't feeling up to it. I Will get back on the horse. I lost my github streak, but its okay, you just got to get through it and push on.

### R1D4 Monday January 8th 2018

I was able to get some coding in today. It was a long drive back from work in the rain, but I pushed through it and pushed a few commits to github. I updated my computer as well. I was thinking about doing this 6 week math class, but I realized that it probably wouldn't be the smartest thing to do since classes that are condensed like that aren't the most knowledge efficient.

## R1D5 Tuesday January 9th 2018

I pushed a few lines of code to github today. There was alot of rain today, so it took me a while to get home.


## R1D6 Wednesday January 10th 2018

Today, I am trying to write some of the freeCodeCamp's beginning algorithm challeneges. In addition, I am working on the portfolio project.


## R1D7 Thursday January 10th 2018

Almost to the end of the week! Today I am going to work on a an algorithm or 2, Write some code on FCC. Read the big-0 notation chapter in cracking the code interview, and apply for a few jobs. 


## R1D7 Friday January 11th 2018

We finished a week of 100 days of code. That is quite impressive I might say. I haven't been able to get as much coding done as I would have hoped, but this mission is keeping me motivated. I'm going to read the big-0 notation chapter in CTCI as well as learn recursion and push a code example. I also pushed my ARKIT code to github.
